# Portfolio Migration - Executive Summary

**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Status:** Ready for Parallel Execution
**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours (with 2 workers)

---

## What We've Done

Removed **all Job Finder functionality** from the codebase:

- 🗑️ **50+ files deleted** (pages, components, contexts, hooks, API clients, backend services)
- 🗑️ **10+ Cloud Functions removed** (generator, queue, resume upload, experience management)
- 🗑️ **All AI/PDF services removed** (OpenAI, Gemini, Puppeteer, PDF generation)
- ✅ **Kept:** Homepage, contact form, legal pages, basic components

---

## What's Left to Do

### Worker A: Configuration (2-3 hours)

1. Remove unused NPM packages (~70% of dependencies can go)
2. Clean up `firebase.json` (remove deleted function routes)
3. Update documentation

### Worker B: Contact & Testing (2-3 hours)

1. Verify contact form works standalone
2. Remove dead imports from contact components
3. Create `/app` placeholder page
4. Run E2E tests

---

## Quick Start

### For Worker A:

```bash
# Start with frontend dependencies
cd web
# Edit package.json (see MIGRATION_PLAN_TWO_WORKERS.md section A1)
npm install
npm run build

# Then backend dependencies
cd ../functions
# Edit package.json (see section A2)
npm install
npm run build
```

### For Worker B:

```bash
# Test contact form
cd web
npm run develop
# Visit http://localhost:8000/contact
# Submit test form

# Check for dead imports
grep -r "useAuth\|AuthContext\|firebase/auth" src/
```

---

## Risk Assessment

### 🔴 High Risk (Test Thoroughly)

- Contact form email delivery
- Homepage rendering (Gatsby/MDX)

### 🟡 Medium Risk (Verify)

- Navigation links (About section, etc.)
- Bundle size after dependency removal

### 🟢 Low Risk (Safe to Change)

- Documentation updates
- Makefile cleanup
- Placeholder pages

---

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Contact form sends email
- ✅ Homepage loads without errors
- ✅ No 404s on navigation
- ✅ Build size < 5MB (down from ~15MB)
- ✅ No Firebase Auth errors in console
- ✅ All tests pass

---

## Rollback Plan

If anything breaks:

1. Revert `package.json` changes
2. Run `npm install` to restore old deps
3. Redeploy from `main` branch

---

## Next Steps After Migration

1. Deploy to staging → test → deploy to production
2. Monitor for errors (24 hours)
3. Plan new React app architecture for `/app`
4. Celebrate clean codebase! 🎉
