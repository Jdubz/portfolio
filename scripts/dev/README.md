# Development Utilities

Scripts for development workflow, linting, testing, and debugging.

## Planned Tools

- Development server helpers
- Debug and profiling scripts

## Usage

Tools will be accessible via Makefile commands:

```bash
make lint
make test

## Contributing

When adding development utilities:

1. Keep scripts focused on development workflow
2. Add corresponding Makefile targets
3. Document usage and purpose
4. Follow the naming convention: descriptive but concise filenames
