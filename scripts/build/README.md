# Build Utilities

Scripts for build optimization, bundling, and deployment preparation.

## Planned Tools

- Bundle analysis and optimization
- Asset compression and minification
- Deployment preparation scripts
- Performance monitoring tools

## Usage

Tools will be accessible via Makefile commands:

```bash
make build-analyze
make build-optimize
make deploy-prep
```

## Contributing

When adding build utilities:

1. Focus on build-time optimizations
2. Add corresponding Makefile targets  
3. Document performance impact
4. Consider cross-platform compatibility
