# Job Finder Frontend Migration Plan

**Last updated:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** Phase 1-3 Complete (API Layer, Job Finder, Job Applications)

## Overview

This document captures the end-to-end plan for extracting the Job Finder experience from the `portfolio` repository and delivering a dedicated React + shadcn UI application in `../job-finder-FE`, while preserving the existing portfolio home page and contact form. It also covers infrastructure, security, deployment, documentation, and operational considerations.

## Objectives

- Maintain uninterrupted availability of the portfolio home page (`/`) and contact form (`/contact`).
- Deliver a React 18 + Vite application styled with shadcn (blue preset) for all Job Finder features.
- Leverage `@jdubz/job-finder-shared-types` as the canonical interface contract across frontends, Firebase Functions, and backend services.
- Preserve existing Firebase Functions, Firestore rules, and Google Cloud logging integrations.
- Provision Cloudflare DNS and Firebase Hosting targets via infrastructure-as-code (Terraform).
- Support staging (`staging.job-finder.joshwentworth.com`) and production (`job-finder.joshwentworth.com`) environments with automated CI/CD.

## Constraints & Assumptions

- Gatsby- and Theme UI-specific code will not be ported; the new UI targets a clean shadcn implementation with functional parity.
- Hosting remains on Firebase Hosting; Cloudflare provides DNS/front-door routing only.
- OAuth providers and Firebase Auth continue to use the same Google Cloud project.
- All Terraform/automation runs from the `portfolio` repo infrastructure directory unless otherwise specified.

## High-Level Phases

   - ðŸ“‹ Phase 4: Document Builder Page (Next)
   - ðŸ“‹ Phase 5: Content Items Page
   - ðŸ“‹ Phase 6: Admin Pages (Queue, Config, Prompts)
4. **CI/CD & Environment Hardening** â€“ ðŸ“‹ **PENDING** â€“ Build pipelines ready, needs deployment setup
5. **Cutover & Validation** â€“ ðŸ“‹ **PENDING** â€“ Awaiting feature completion
6. **Portfolio Cleanup** â€“ âœ… **COMPLETE** â€“ Job Finder already removed from portfolio

**Note:** Portfolio cleanup was completed ahead of schedule. The `/app` route currently shows a placeholder "Coming Soon" page pending the new application deployment.

## Repository Gotchas & Improvement Opportunities

### Front-End (Gatsby) Footprint

- `web/src/pages/resume-builder.tsx` owns tabbed routing via query params (`?tab=`). Redirect mapping must cover every legacy tab slug to the new router.
- Theme UI, custom hooks (`useAuth`, `TabsGrouped`, etc.), and the recently added `JobFinderThemeProvider` are tightly coupled; plan for adapters or shims while features move to shadcn.
- `web/public/` contains built Gatsby assets that can mask redirect issues during local testing; clear the folder when verifying migration logic.
- Patch scripts (`update:partytown`, `patch-package`) run on install/buildâ€”validate whether they are still needed after Job Finder removal to avoid dangling artifacts.

### Shared Types & Dependencies

- Current workspaces reference the shared types package inconsistently (`@jdubz/...` vs `@jsdubzw/...`). Standardize naming before splitting repos to prevent accidentally publishing multiple packages.
- Ensure `@jdubz/job-finder-shared-types` remains the single source for queue, logging, and settings contracts; any schema change should flow through that package before app/function updates.

### Firebase Functions Surface Area

- `functions/src/` hosts both contact-form and Job Finder logic. When extracting, decide whether contact form stays in this repo or moves to a dedicated workspace to reduce lint/test noise.
- Generated `.d.ts` files under `functions/deploy/` trigger ESLint parser errors (`parserOptions.project`). In the new layout, either exclude generated directories or supply a dedicated tsconfig.
- Scripts such as `functions/setup-secrets.sh` assume the `static-sites-257923` project; parameterize or document if the new app introduces additional environments.

### Scripts & Tooling

- Root scripts (`scripts/import-staging-to-local.ts`, `scripts/copy-job-matches-to-emulator.ts`, etc.) rely on Job Finder collections and should migrate alongside the new app.
- Firestore export snapshots under `firestore-exports/` and emulator data under `emulator-data/` reference the existing schema. Plan a cleanup/refresh step to avoid stale migrations after the split.
- `Makefile`, `lhci`, and screenshot workflows may reference removed routes; audit these tasks to avoid CI failures post-migration.

### CI/CD & Linting

- Current lint runs flag hundreds of errors due to shared TypeScript configs. Stabilize linting in each repo before activating required checks for the new pipelines.
- `npm run test --workspaces` executes both Gatsby and Functions suites; after extraction ensure CI still covers contact form tests from this repo and introduces equivalent coverage in `job-finder-FE`.
- Verify existing GitHub Actions (deploy, screenshots, PR checks) to see which ones assume the presence of `/resume-builder` content and update them in tandem with redirects.

## Shared Types & Contracts

- Treat `@jdubz/job-finder-shared-types` as the source of truth for queue items, job matches, settings, logger types, etc.
- Publish versioned releases (or workspace symlinks) whenever schemas change.
- Update documentation within the shared types repo to outline serialization rules, date handling, and validation expectations.

## Security & Compliance

- Ensure OAuth redirect URIs, Firebase authorized domains, and Cloudflare DNS changes are deployed atomically to avoid auth drift.
- Review Firestore rules to confirm new domain origins do not introduce unauthorized access.
- Maintain current Google Cloud Logging pipelines; verify log retention and alerting remain aligned with compliance requirements.
- Document incident response steps for the new app (including Cloudflare DNS rollback).

## Documentation & Knowledge Transfer

- Update `README.md` in both repositories with setup, scripts, and deployment instructions.
- Add migration FAQ summarizing differences between Gatsby and React apps, routing patterns, and auth changes.
- Refresh `docs/` content (architecture diagrams, onboarding guides) to reflect the split.
- Provide runbooks for Terraform apply, Firebase deploy, and DNS switches.
- Add `CLAUDE.md` context files in new or relocated directories (e.g., `job-finder-FE`, shared-types additions) summarizing intent, key files, and ownership to keep AI-assisted tooling effective after the split.
- Establish a Claude context management checklist:
  - Keep the root-level `CLAUDE.md` authoritative and trimmed to high-signal guidance, linking out to deeper docs instead of duplicating content.
  - Create scoped `CLAUDE.md` files in high-churn areas of `job-finder-FE` (e.g., `src/features/<feature>/CLAUDE.md`) capped to ~200â€“300 lines focused on architecture, domain contracts, and common gotchas.
  - Add a `docs/claude-context-index.md` (or equivalent) that enumerates every context file, last updated date, and owner so Claude Code can surface the right attachments quickly.
  - Fold repetitive prompt snippets (lint overrides, deploy commands, testing recipes) into short "How to ask" sections within the relevant context files to save tokens during interactive sessions.
  - Schedule context reviews alongside sprint retros so stale or noisy sections are pruned before they erode Claude Code relevance.
- Maintain `docs/development/job-finder-discovery-inventory.md` as the authoritative tracker for routes, functions, and scripts while features migrate.

**Current Status (2025-10-19):** Ahead of schedule - Week 3 tasks complete, starting Week 4 early

## Risk Mitigation

- Maintain dual-running period (portfolio Gatsby + new React app) until confidence is high.
- Set alerting for API error spikes and auth failures post-cutover.
- Keep rollback plan documented (Cloudflare DNS revert + Firebase Hosting rollback).
