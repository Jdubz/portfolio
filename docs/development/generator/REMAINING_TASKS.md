## Optional Enhancements

### 1. Settings Editor UI (Medium Complexity)

**Current State:** Backend fully functional, no UI

**What Exists:**
- ‚úÖ `/generator/defaults` GET endpoint - Fetch default settings
- ‚úÖ `/generator/defaults` PUT endpoint - Update default settings
- ‚úÖ Full TypeScript types (`GeneratorDefaults`, `UpdateDefaultsData`)
- ‚úÖ Validation and error handling
- ‚úÖ Editor-only access control

**What's Missing:**
- ‚ùå React form component for editing defaults
- ‚ùå Route at `/resume-builder/settings` (or similar)
- ‚ùå Integration with auth system (already have `useAuth` hook)

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create new page: `web/src/pages/resume-settings.tsx`
2. Use existing API client methods (need to add `getDefaults()` and `updateDefaults()`)
3. Build form with fields:
   - Personal: name, email, phone, location
   - Links: website, github, linkedin
   - Visuals: accent color picker
4. Add auth check (must be editor)
5. Add navigation link from resume-builder

**Complexity:** ~2-3 hours

**Value:** Medium - Currently editors can update via direct API calls or scripts

---

### 2. Document History UI (Medium Complexity)

**Current State:** Backend queries work, no UI

**What Exists:**
- ‚úÖ All data stored in Firestore (`generator` collection)
- ‚úÖ Composite indexes for efficient queries
- ‚úÖ Query examples in SCHEMA.md
- ‚úÖ Full document structure with all metadata

**What's Missing:**
- ‚ùå React component to display history
- ‚ùå Pagination for long lists
- ‚ùå Filtering (by date, company, type)
- ‚ùå Re-download or view past documents

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create API client method `getHistory()`
   ```typescript
   async getHistory(options?: {
     startDate?: Date
     limit?: number
     company?: string
   }): Promise<GenerationRequest[]>
   ```

2. Create component: `web/src/components/GeneratorHistory.tsx`
   - Table with columns: Date, Company, Role, Type, Status, Actions
   - Download button (opens signed URL if valid, or regenerates)
   - Filter inputs (date range, company search)

3. Add to resume-builder page as separate section (or new route)

4. Add auth check (editor only, or viewer with session filter)

**Complexity:** ~4-6 hours

**Value:** High for frequent users, Low for occasional use

---

### 3. Enhanced Rate Limiting (Low Complexity)

**Current State:** Works well, uses session ID for all users

**Current Implementation:**
```typescript
const sessionId = req.body.sessionId || generateSessionId()
const limit = isEditor ? 20 : 10
await checkRateLimit(sessionId, limit)
```

**Proposed Enhancement:**
```typescript
// Use user.uid for authenticated users
const identifier = user?.uid || req.body.sessionId || generateSessionId()
const limit = isEditor ? 20 : 10
await checkRateLimit(identifier, limit)
```

**Benefits:**
- Rate limit follows user across devices
- Better tracking for authenticated users
- Prevents abuse from creating new sessions

**Complexity:** ~30 minutes

**Value:** Low - Current system works fine

---

### 4. Additional Templates (High Complexity)

**Current State:** Single "modern" template

**What Would Be Required:**
1. Design 3+ new templates (traditional, technical, executive, creative)
2. Create Handlebars templates for each
3. Update PDF service to support template selection
4. Add template preview images
5. Update UI with template selector
6. Test PDF generation for all templates
7. Ensure consistency across templates

**Complexity:** ~20-30 hours (mostly design work)

**Value:** Medium - "Modern" template covers 90% of use cases

**Note:** This was intentionally removed in Phase 2.3 to simplify the system

---

### 5. Batch Generation (High Complexity)

**Current State:** One generation per request

**Use Case:** User applying to 10 jobs, wants 10 customized resumes

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create new endpoint: `POST /generator/batch`
   ```typescript
   {
     jobs: Array<{
       role: string
       company: string
       jobDescriptionUrl?: string
     }>,
     generateType: "resume" | "coverLetter" | "both"
   }
   ```

2. Backend processes in parallel (with concurrency limits)

3. Return array of request IDs

4. Client polls for status or uses webhooks

5. UI shows progress bar with individual job statuses

6. Zip file download option for all PDFs

**Complexity:** ~15-20 hours

**Value:** High for job seekers, Rare use case

---

### 6. Resume Templates Library (Medium Complexity)

**Current State:** User provides job description each time

**Enhancement:** Save and reuse common job descriptions

**Implementation:**
1. New Firestore collection: `generator-templates`
   ```typescript
   {
     id: string
     userId: string
     name: string  // "Software Engineer at Tech Startup"
     job: JobDetails
     preferences: GenerationPreferences
     createdAt: Timestamp
   }
   ```

2. API endpoints: `/generator/templates` (GET, POST, DELETE)

3. UI: "Save as template" button, dropdown to load template

**Complexity:** ~6-8 hours

**Value:** Medium - Useful for users applying to similar roles

---

### 7. Cover Letter Only Mode (Low Complexity)

**Current State:** Cover letter backend exists, not fully tested in UI

**What's Missing:**
- Thorough testing of cover letter-only generation
- UI polish (currently just dropdown selection)
- Example/preview of cover letter format

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Add cover letter preview in UI
2. Add cover letter-specific mock data
3. Test edge cases (missing personal info, etc.)
4. Document cover letter prompt engineering

**Complexity:** ~2-3 hours

**Value:** Low - Most users want both documents

---

### 8. Integration Tests for Full Flow (Low Complexity)

**Current State:** Unit tests comprehensive, no full E2E tests

**What Would Be Required:**
1. Playwright tests for full UI flow:
   - Fill form ‚Üí Generate ‚Üí Download PDF
   - Test both providers
   - Test auth flow
   - Test error states

2. Integration tests for Cloud Function:
   - Test with real Firestore emulator
   - Test with real Storage emulator
