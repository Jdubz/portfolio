# Archive - Old Generator Documentation

> **Last Updated:** October 11, 2025
> **Reason for Archive:** Consolidation to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability

These files are kept for reference but are no longer maintained. All essential information has been consolidated into the main README.md.

## Consolidation Summary

**Before:**

- 10 documentation files
- ~5,686 total lines
- Significant redundancy across files
- Hard to find current status
- Multiple sources of truth

**After:**

- 2 essential files: [README.md](../README.md) + [SCHEMA.md](../SCHEMA.md)
- ~700 lines of focused documentation
- Single source of truth
- Clear current status and roadmap
- **87% reduction in documentation overhead**

## Why Archived?

### Problems with Old Structure

1. **Redundancy:** Same information repeated across multiple files
2. **Outdated:** Planning docs referenced features that changed or weren't built
3. **Hard to Navigate:** No clear entry point for new contributors
4. **Maintenance Burden:** Updates needed across multiple files
5. **Version Confusion:** Multiple "status" and "progress" docs with conflicting info

### New Structure Benefits

1. **Single Entry Point:** README.md has everything you need
2. **Current Information:** Consolidated docs are up-to-date
3. **Easy Maintenance:** Update one file, not five
4. **Clear Hierarchy:** README â†’ SCHEMA for reference
5. **Better DX:** Developers can onboard faster
