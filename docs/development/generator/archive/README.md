# Archive - Old Generator Documentation

These files are kept for reference but are no longer maintained.

## Archived Files

### ai-resume-generator-plan.md (1,638 lines)
**Original planning document** - Comprehensive but now outdated
- Written before Phase 1 implementation
- Contains many features that weren't built or changed during implementation
- **Replaced by:** [../README.md](../README.md) and [../PHASE_2_PLAN.md](../PHASE_2_PLAN.md)

### generator-implementation-guide.md (1,001 lines)
**Code patterns and implementation guide** - Useful but redundant
- Documents existing codebase patterns to follow
- Most examples now exist in actual codebase
- **Better reference:** Look at actual code in `functions/src/` and `web/src/`

### resume-generator-setup.md (377 lines)
**Setup instructions** - Partially outdated
- Mix of implementation notes and setup steps
- **Replaced by:** [../README.md](../README.md) "Local Development" section

### AI_RESUME_GENERATOR_STATUS.md (529 lines)
**Phase 1 status report** - Comprehensive but verbose
- Detailed implementation status after Phase 1
- Lots of overlap with other docs
- **Replaced by:** [../README.md](../README.md) and [../PHASE_2_PLAN.md](../PHASE_2_PLAN.md)

## Why Archived?

**Before:** 4,841 lines across 5 documents with significant redundancy
**After:** 1,296 lines across 3 focused documents (73% reduction)

The new structure is:
1. **README.md** - Entry point, current status, quick start
2. **PHASE_2_PLAN.md** - Next steps with clear tasks
3. **SCHEMA.md** - Database reference (kept as-is, well-written)

## Need Something from These Files?

Most content was consolidated into the new docs. If you need specific details:
- **Current status** → [../README.md](../README.md)
- **Next steps** → [../PHASE_2_PLAN.md](../PHASE_2_PLAN.md)
- **Database schema** → [../SCHEMA.md](../SCHEMA.md)
- **Code patterns** → Look at actual implementation
- **Original planning** → Still here for reference
