# AI Resume Generator - Implementation Status

> **Last Updated:** October 10, 2025
> **Current Phase:** Phase 1 Complete ✅ | Phase 2 Planning

## Executive Summary

The AI Resume Generator Phase 1 MVP has been successfully implemented and is working in local development. The feature generates tailored resumes using OpenAI's API, exports them as PDF with logo/avatar support, and tracks all generation metadata in Firestore.

**Key Achievement:** Resume-only generation working end-to-end with PDF export, OpenAI integration, and Firestore tracking.

## Phase 1: Implementation Complete ✅

### What Was Built

#### Backend Services (`functions/src/`)

1. **GeneratorService** ([services/generator.service.ts](../../functions/src/services/generator.service.ts))
   - CRUD operations for `generator` collection
   - Methods: `getDefaults()`, `updateDefaults()`, `createRequest()`, `createResponse()`, `getRequest()`, `getResponse()`
   - Firestore request/response document tracking
   - Type-safe interfaces for all operations

2. **OpenAIService** ([services/openai.service.ts](../../functions/src/services/openai.service.ts))
   - OpenAI API integration with structured outputs
   - Resume generation with GPT-4o model
   - Cover letter generation (implemented but not fully integrated)
   - Token usage tracking and cost calculation
   - Mock mode for local development (OPENAI_MOCK_MODE=true)

3. **PDFService** ([services/pdf.service.ts](../../functions/src/services/pdf.service.ts))
   - Puppeteer-based PDF generation
   - Handlebars template rendering
   - Modern resume template with logo/avatar support
   - Accent color customization
   - Local Chrome detection for development

4. **Cloud Function** ([generator.ts](../../functions/src/generator.ts))
   - `manageGenerator` HTTP function
   - Routes:
     - `POST /generator/generate` - Generate resume (public, with rate limiting)
     - `GET /generator/defaults` - Get default settings (public)
   - CORS configuration for localhost:8000 and production domains
   - Rate limiting (10 requests per 15 minutes)
   - Error handling with structured error codes (GEN_*)

#### Frontend (`web/src/`)

1. **GeneratorClient** ([api/generator-client.ts](../../web/src/api/generator-client.ts))
   - Extends ApiClient base class
   - Methods: `generate()`, `getDefaults()`
   - Comprehensive contract tests (28 passing tests)
   - Type-safe request/response handling

2. **Resume Builder Page** ([pages/resume-builder.tsx](../../web/src/pages/resume-builder.tsx))
   - Basic viewer form for job details
   - Real-time generation with progress indicators
   - PDF download with base64 encoding
   - Success/error messaging
   - Token usage and cost display

3. **Type Definitions** ([types/generator.ts](../../web/src/types/generator.ts))
   - Shared types between frontend and backend
   - `GenerationType`, `GenerationMetadata`, `GenerateRequest`, `GenerateResponse`

#### Database Schema

**Collection:** `generator`

**Documents:**
- `default` - Default personal settings (name, email, avatar, logo, etc.)
- `resume-generator-request-{id}` - Generation request with input snapshots
- `resume-generator-response-{id}` - Generated content, files, metrics

See [generator-firestore-schema.md](./generator-firestore-schema.md) for complete schema documentation.

#### Templates

**Handlebars Templates** ([functions/templates/](../../functions/templates/))
- `resume-modern.hbs` - Modern resume template with clean design
- Logo and avatar support with base64 encoding
- Accent color customization
- Responsive layout for Letter size paper

- Structured OpenAI outputs

✅ **Testing**
- 28 API client contract tests
- Service-level unit tests
- Error handling coverage
- Mock implementations for all services

### What Changed from Original Plan

#### Simplified Scope
- **Resume only** (not resume + cover letter in single generation)
- **Base64 PDF response** instead of GCS storage with signed URLs
- **No authentication required** for viewer flow
- **No document management UI** for editors

#### Technical Decisions
1. **No GCS Storage (Yet)**
   - PDFs returned as base64 in API response
   - Simpler for MVP, no storage costs
   - Can add GCS in Phase 2 for document history

2. **Resume-Only First**
   - Cover letter service implemented but not exposed
   - Can enable in Phase 2 with checkbox or separate button

3. **Minimal UI**
   - Basic form with job details
   - No authentication/editor features yet
   - Focus on proving core generation works

4. **Local Chrome Detection**
   - Added logic to use local Chrome in development
   - Falls back to @sparticuz/chromium in production
   - Faster cold starts during development

### Bugs Fixed During Implementation

1. **Firestore Undefined Values**
   - **Issue:** Firestore rejects `undefined` values in documents
   - **Fix:** Conditional object building for optional fields
   - **Commits:** d46eb49

2. **React Object Rendering**
   - **Issue:** Cannot render tokenUsage object as React child
   - **Fix:** Updated type to `{total: number}` and accessed `.total` property
   - **Commits:** 75f2278

3. **Handlebars Template Copying**
   - **Issue:** Templates not copied to dist/ during build
   - **Fix:** Updated package.json build script
   - **Commits:** 03e648b

4. **Chrome Detection for Puppeteer**
   - **Issue:** Puppeteer failed to find Chrome in local development
   - **Fix:** Try multiple Chrome paths, fallback to chromium
   - **File:** functions/src/services/pdf.service.ts

### Current Limitations

1. **Cover Letter Generation**
   - Service implemented but not exposed in UI
   - Can generate cover letters via API
   - Need to add UI toggle

2. **No Document History**
   - PDFs not stored permanently
   - Each generation is new, no retrieval
   - Need GCS storage for history

3. **No Authentication**
   - All users are "viewers"
   - No editor features (prompt editing, viewing all generations)
   - No access control

4. **Single Template**
   - Only "modern" style implemented
   - Other styles (traditional, technical, executive) need templates

5. **No Rate Limiting Bypass for Editors**
   - All users subject to same rate limits
   - Should have higher limits for authenticated users

   - Proposed: `findLocalChrome()` helper method
   - Benefit: Better readability and testability

2. **Extract Job Description Builder** (generator.ts)
   - Current: Duplicated at lines 272-274 and 319-322
   - Proposed: `buildJobDescription(job)` helper
   - Benefit: DRY principle, easier maintenance

3. **Document Service Account Configuration** (experience.ts)
   - Current: Changed from cloud-functions-builder to compute service account
   - Needed: Document why and when to use each account
   - Benefit: Clarity for future deployments

**Estimated Effort:** 1 day

---

### Phase 2 Total Timeline

**Estimated Effort:** 12-17 days (2-3 weeks)

**Priority Order:**
1. Cover letter integration (quick win)
2. Authentication & editor features (unlock other features)
3. GCS storage & document history (enables persistence)
4. Prompt management (enables customization)
5. Additional templates (nice to have)

   - GCS in Phase 2 for document history

2. ✅ **Resume only or resume + cover letter?**
   - Decision: Resume only for Phase 1
   - Cover letter in Phase 2.1 (easy to add)

3. ✅ **Require authentication for viewers?**
   - Decision: No, public access for Phase 1
   - Editor features in Phase 2.3

4. ✅ **Mock mode for local development?**
   - Decision: Yes, OPENAI_MOCK_MODE=true
   - Prevents token usage during development

5. ✅ **How to handle Puppeteer in local dev?**

   - Faster cold starts during development

### Open for Phase 2
1. **Should we combine resume + cover letter into single generation?**
   - Option A: Always generate both (simpler)
   - Option B: Checkbox to generate cover letter (flexible)
   - Leaning toward Option B

2. **How long should signed URLs last?**
   - Viewers: 1 hour (short-lived)
   - Editors: 7 days (longer access)
   - Or permanent access via re-generation?

3. **Should we allow editing generated resumes?**
   - Pros: User can tweak before download
   - Cons: Complex UI, scope creep
   - Likely defer to Phase 3
