## üìö Technical Debt

### Type Safety
- [ ] Remove all `@ts-expect-error` suppressions when library updates available:

  - `theme-ui` v0.18 (currently in beta)
  - `gatsby-plugin-image` sx prop types

### Dependencies
- [ ] Upgrade to Theme UI v0.18 when stable (React 18 fixes)
- [ ] Review and update all dependencies quarterly
- [ ] Remove `legacy-peer-deps` flag once Theme UI is updated
- [ ] Evaluate replacing deprecated packages

### Code Quality
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate gradient patterns
- [ ] Extract magic numbers to theme constants
- [ ] Standardize error handling patterns
- [ ] Refactor large components (>200 lines)

### Build Process
- [ ] Investigate faster build times (currently ~2-3min)
- [ ] Optimize CI/CD pipeline (parallel jobs where possible)
- [ ] Reduce Docker image sizes for Cloud Functions
- [ ] Cache Gatsby build artifacts more effectively

## üîç Investigations

### To Research
- [ ] Evaluate migration to Gatsby v6 when released
- [ ] Research alternatives to Firebase Hosting (cost vs features)
- [ ] Investigate Cloudflare Workers for edge functions
- [ ] Explore static generation of project pages from data source

### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Set up Firebase Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Add Core Web Vitals tracking to Analytics
- [ ] Monitor Cloud Functions cold start times
- [ ] Track bundle size over time

## üìù Notes

### Decision Log
- **Firebase Analytics**: Enabled in production/staging, disabled in dev to avoid data pollution
- **Monorepo Structure**: Chose npm workspaces over Lerna for simplicity
- **Styling**: Using Theme UI for consistency and maintainability
- **Forms**: Cloud Functions over client-side email for security

### Won't Do (At This Time)
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Not needed for portfolio site (static is fine)
- **CMS Integration**: Overkill for personal portfolio
- **Multi-language Support**: English-only audience
- **Authentication**: No user accounts needed
