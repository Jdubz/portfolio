## üéØ High Priority

### üî¥ Critical (Week 1)

#### UX/UI Improvements
- [ ] **Fix Experience Page Login/Error UX** (TOP PRIORITY)
  - Current issues:
    - Error messages need better visibility and styling
    - Sign-in button UX needs polish (loading states, disabled states)
    - No clear feedback when auth fails
    - Error persistence and retry flow unclear
  - Improvements needed:
    - Add proper error Alert component with retry action
    - Improve button states (idle, loading, error, success)
    - Add toast notifications for auth state changes
    - Better mobile responsiveness for auth controls
    - Add "What went wrong?" help text for common errors
  - Effort: 3-4 hours
  - Impact: High - blocks experience page usage

- [x] **Fix Google OAuth 404 Redirect Issue** (COMPLETED)
  - Root cause: authDomain was set to firebaseapp.com default instead of custom domains
  - Fixed by updating GATSBY_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN in .env.staging and .env.production
  - Staging: staging.joshwentworth.com
  - Production: joshwentworth.com
  - Added all redirect URIs to OAuth client in Google Cloud Console
  - Note: www.joshwentworth.com redirects via Cloudflare to apex domain

#### Security & Dependencies
- [x] **Update security dependencies** (COMPLETED - 10 vulnerabilities remain in dev deps)
  - Ran `npm audit fix && npm update --workspaces`
  - Updated 1552 packages successfully
  - Build tested and passing
  - Note: Remaining vulnerabilities are in dev dependencies (Gatsby/Lighthouse CI)
  - Force fixes would cause breaking changes (Gatsby downgrade)
  - Dev dependencies pose minimal production risk


### Analytics Enhancements
- [x] **Add cookie consent banner for GDPR compliance** (COMPLETED)
  - Created CookieConsent component with accept/decline options
  - Stores user preference in localStorage

  - ‚úÖ Social media link clicks (GitHub source code)
  - Resume downloads - TODO (no resume download feature yet)
  - Section navigation - TODO (nice to have)

### Performance Optimization
- [x] **Lazy load Firebase** (COMPLETED - ~200KB savings on non-contact pages)
  - Firebase now only loads when ContactForm component mounts
  - Homepage loads ~200KB less JavaScript
  - Build time improved from 18s to 10.7s
  - Firebase split into separate 40KB chunk
- [x] **Add bundle size tracking to PR pipeline** (COMPLETED)
  - Installed @size-limit/preset-app and @size-limit/file
  - Created .size-limit.json with limits for all major bundles
  - Added GitHub Action (size-limit.yml) to run on PRs
  - Added npm scripts: size, size:why
  - Tracks: main app bundle, framework, homepage, contact page, Firebase chunk
- [ ] **Further bundle optimizations**
  - Route-based code splitting for remaining pages
  - Optimize images (convert to WebP, add responsive sizes)
  - Tree-shake unused Theme UI components
  - Effort: 4-6 hours
- [ ] Add service worker for offline support
- [ ] Optimize background icon SVG rendering

## üîß Medium Priority

### Testing
- [x] **Add E2E tests for contact form** (COMPLETED)
  - Created playwright.config.ts
  - Added e2e/contact-form.spec.ts with 9 comprehensive tests
  - Tests: form display, validation, loading states, success/error handling, timeout, accessibility
  - Added npm scripts: test:e2e, test:e2e:ui, test:e2e:debug, test:e2e:report
  - Configured for 5 browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari)
- [ ] **Increase test coverage to 70%+** (Currently ~50% web, ~65% functions)
  - ContactForm edge cases (network errors, timeout)
  - Error boundaries
  - Firebase initialization
  - Effort: 6-8 hours
- [ ] Add visual regression testing for component screenshots
- [ ] Test Firebase Analytics event tracking
- [ ] **Add Lighthouse CI to PR pipeline** (prevent performance regressions)
  - Effort: 2 hours

### Documentation
- [ ] Create architecture diagrams for system overview
- [ ] Add video walkthrough of local development setup

- [ ] Create troubleshooting FAQ

### Developer Experience
- [x] Add pre-commit hooks for automated formatting (COMPLETED - Husky configured)

## üöÄ Low Priority / Future

### Features
- [ ] Add dark mode toggle (Theme UI supports it)

- [ ] Implement search functionality
- [ ] Add RSS feed for updates

### Infrastructure

- [ ] Create XML sitemap for projects (if added as pages)
- [ ] Add meta descriptions for all pages

## üìö Technical Debt

### Type Safety
- [ ] Remove all `@ts-expect-error` suppressions when library updates available:
  - `@react-spring/parallax` React 18 types
  - `theme-ui` v0.18 (currently in beta)
  - `gatsby-plugin-image` sx prop types

### Dependencies
- [ ] Upgrade to Theme UI v0.18 when stable (React 18 fixes)
- [ ] Review and update all dependencies quarterly
- [ ] Remove `legacy-peer-deps` flag once Theme UI is updated
- [ ] Evaluate replacing deprecated packages

### Code Quality
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate gradient patterns
- [ ] Extract magic numbers to theme constants
- [ ] Standardize error handling patterns
- [ ] Refactor large components (>200 lines)

### Build Process
- [ ] Investigate faster build times (currently ~2-3min)
- [ ] Optimize CI/CD pipeline (parallel jobs where possible)
- [ ] Reduce Docker image sizes for Cloud Functions
- [ ] Cache Gatsby build artifacts more effectively

## üîç Investigations

### To Research
- [ ] Evaluate migration to Gatsby v6 when released
- [ ] Research alternatives to Firebase Hosting (cost vs features)
- [ ] Investigate Cloudflare Workers for edge functions
- [ ] Explore static generation of project pages from data source

### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Set up Firebase Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Add Core Web Vitals tracking to Analytics
- [ ] Monitor Cloud Functions cold start times
- [ ] Track bundle size over time

## üìù Notes

### Decision Log
- **Firebase Analytics**: Enabled in production/staging, disabled in dev to avoid data pollution
- **Monorepo Structure**: Chose npm workspaces over Lerna for simplicity
- **Styling**: Using Theme UI for consistency and maintainability
- **Forms**: Cloud Functions over client-side email for security

### Won't Do (At This Time)
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Not needed for portfolio site (static is fine)
- **CMS Integration**: Overkill for personal portfolio
- **Multi-language Support**: English-only audience
- **Authentication**: No user accounts needed
