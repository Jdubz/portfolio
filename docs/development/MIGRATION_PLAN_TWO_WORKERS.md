# Job Finder FE Migration: 2-Worker Approach with Git Worktrees

**Created:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** Ready for Execution
**Context:** This plan splits the job-finder-FE migration work between two parallel workers using Git worktrees to prevent conflicts.

## Overview

The migration extracts Job Finder functionality from the portfolio monorepo into the standalone `job-finder-FE` React application. We're currently 45% complete (API layer, Job Finder page, Job Applications page done). This plan splits the remaining work between two workers using Git worktrees for isolated parallel development.

### Current Progress (45% Complete)

- âœ… Infrastructure scaffolded (React + Vite + TypeScript)
- âœ… API client layer with retry/backoff patterns
- âœ… Auth & session management (Firebase Auth + custom claims)
- âœ… Job Finder page (job submission)
- âœ… Job Applications page (matches display with filters/modal)
- âœ… Shared types package (`@jdubz/job-finder-shared-types`)

### Remaining Work (55%)

- ðŸ“‹ Document Builder page (AI resume/cover letter generation) - **PRIORITY**
- ðŸ“‹ Content Items page (experience/skills management)
- ðŸ“‹ Admin pages (Queue Management, AI Prompts, Job Finder Config, Settings)
- ðŸ“‹ E2E test suite
- ðŸ“‹ CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- ðŸ“‹ Documentation & knowledge transfer

## Git Worktree Strategy

### Why Worktrees?

- **Parallel Development**: Workers can develop simultaneously without branch conflicts
- **Isolated Testing**: Each worker can run tests/builds without affecting the other
- **Easy Context Switching**: Switch between worker branches without stashing
- **Shared Git History**: Both workers share the same `.git` directory (commits, branches, remotes)

### Worktree Structure

```
job-finder-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ job-finder-FE/              # Main working directory (main branch)
â”œâ”€â”€ job-finder-FE-worker-a/     # Worker A worktree (worker-a branch)
â””â”€â”€ job-finder-FE-worker-b/     # Worker B worktree (worker-b branch)
```

### Setup Commands

```bash
# Navigate to the main repo
cd /home/jdubz/Development/job-finder-app/job-finder-FE

# Create Worker A branch and worktree
git checkout -b worker-a main
git worktree add ../job-finder-FE-worker-a worker-a

# Create Worker B branch and worktree
git checkout -b worker-b main
git worktree add ../job-finder-FE-worker-b worker-b

# Verify worktrees
git worktree list

# Expected output:
# /home/jdubz/Development/job-finder-app/job-finder-FE              [main]
# /home/jdubz/Development/job-finder-app/job-finder-FE-worker-a    [worker-a]
# /home/jdubz/Development/job-finder-app/job-finder-FE-worker-b    [worker-b]
```

### Worktree Workflow

1. **Initial Setup**: Both workers branch from `main` (current 45% state)
2. **Development**: Each worker commits to their branch independently
3. **Testing**: Run tests in each worktree before merging
4. **Integration**: Merge worker-a â†’ main, then worker-b â†’ main
5. **Conflict Resolution**: Worker B rebases on main after Worker A merge
6. **Cleanup**: Remove worktrees after completion

---

## Worker Division Strategy

### **Worker A: Backend-Heavy Features**

Focus on features requiring deep backend integration, API calls, and data management.

**Responsibilities:**

- Document Builder (AI generation)
- Content Items (experience/skills CRUD)
- Queue Management (admin view)
- Backend API integration testing
- Firestore real-time listener optimization

**Rationale:** These features require understanding portfolio's Firebase Functions architecture, Firestore data models, and AI provider integration. Worker A will need to reference the portfolio codebase frequently.

---

### **Worker B: UI-Heavy Features & Infrastructure**

Focus on admin UI, settings, configuration pages, and deployment infrastructure.

**Responsibilities:**

- AI Prompts page (prompt customization)
- Job Finder Config page (settings management)
- Document History page (generated docs display)
- Settings page (user preferences)
- E2E test suite (Playwright)
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Documentation updates

**Rationale:** These features are more UI-focused with lighter backend dependencies. Worker B can work independently on configuration pages while Worker A handles heavy API integrations.

## Dependency Management & Handoff Points

### Critical Dependencies

These tasks must be completed in order to avoid blocking:

1. **Worker A Phase A1 (Document Builder) â†’ Worker B Phase B3 (Document History)**
   - Document History displays documents created via Document Builder
   - Worker B should wait for Worker A to complete document generation API integration

2. **Worker A Phase A2 (Content Items) â†’ Worker A Phase A1 (Document Builder)**
   - Document Builder uses content items (experience, skills) in generation
   - Worker A should complete Content Items before finalizing Document Builder

3. **Worker B Phase B6 (CI/CD) â†’ All Other Phases**
   - CI/CD setup can run in parallel but should be tested after key features are done
   - Both workers should coordinate on CI/CD testing

### Recommended Handoff Points

**End of Week 4:**

- Worker A commits: Document Builder + Content Items
- Worker B commits: AI Prompts + Job Finder Config
- **Handoff Meeting:** Review progress, resolve merge conflicts, plan Week 5

**End of Week 5:**

- Worker A commits: Queue Management + Backend testing
- Worker B commits: Document History + Settings + E2E tests
- **Handoff Meeting:** Review integration points, plan CI/CD deployment

**End of Week 6:**

- Worker B commits: CI/CD pipeline + Documentation
- **Final Review:** Full system test, staging deployment, production cutover plan

---

## Merge Strategy

### Approach: Sequential Merges

To minimize conflicts, merge workers sequentially rather than simultaneously.

#### Step 1: Worker A Merge (End of Week 4)

```bash
# Worker A completes their work
cd /home/jdubz/Development/job-finder-app/job-finder-FE-worker-a
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: add Document Builder and Content Items pages"
git push origin worker-a

# Switch to main and merge Worker A
cd /home/jdubz/Development/job-finder-app/job-finder-FE
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge worker-a --no-ff -m "Merge Worker A: Document Builder + Content Items"

# Run tests to validate merge
npm test

# Push to main
git push origin main
```

#### Step 2: Worker B Rebase (After Worker A Merge)

```bash
# Worker B rebases on updated main to get Worker A's changes
cd /home/jdubz/Development/job-finder-app/job-finder-FE-worker-b
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Resolve any conflicts
# Test after rebase
npm test

# Continue work on Worker B branch
```

#### Step 3: Worker B Merge (End of Week 5)

```bash
# Worker B completes their work
cd /home/jdubz/Development/job-finder-app/job-finder-FE-worker-b
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: add admin pages, E2E tests, and CI/CD"
git push origin worker-b

# Switch to main and merge Worker B
cd /home/jdubz/Development/job-finder-app/job-finder-FE
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge worker-b --no-ff -m "Merge Worker B: Admin pages + CI/CD + Docs"

# Run full test suite
npm test
npm run test:e2e

# Push to main
git push origin main
```

### Conflict Resolution Strategy

- **File-Level Conflicts:** Most likely in `src/router.tsx`, `package.json`
- **Resolution:** Worker B rebases on main after Worker A merge, manually resolves conflicts
- **Testing:** Always run full test suite after resolving conflicts

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Worker A and Worker B create overlapping components

**Mitigation:**

- Clear task boundaries in this plan
- Regular standups to discuss progress
- Worker B rebases on Worker A's merge before continuing

### Risk 2: Breaking changes in shared-types package

**Mitigation:**

- Lock shared-types version in `package.json`
- Coordinate schema changes with both workers
- Version shared-types package before breaking changes

### Risk 3: CI/CD pipeline breaks existing deployments

**Mitigation:**

- Test CI/CD on separate test repository first
- Use dry-run deployments before production
- Keep rollback plan documented

### Risk 4: Merge conflicts in router or API client files

**Mitigation:**

- Worker A focuses on data-heavy routes
- Worker B focuses on config/admin routes
- Use feature-based file organization to minimize overlap

### Risk 5: Firestore schema changes break existing data

**Mitigation:**

- Run migrations in staging first
- Use Firestore schema versioning
- Keep portfolio functions running during migration for comparison

---

## Rollback Plan

### If Worker A Merge Fails

```bash
# Revert the merge
cd /home/jdubz/Development/job-finder-app/job-finder-FE
git checkout main
git revert -m 1 HEAD  # Revert merge commit
git push origin main

# Worker A fixes issues on worker-a branch
cd /home/jdubz/Development/job-finder-app/job-finder-FE-worker-a
# Fix issues, test, recommit
```

### If Worker B Merge Fails

```bash
# Revert the merge
cd /home/jdubz/Development/job-finder-app/job-finder-FE
git checkout main
git revert -m 1 HEAD  # Revert merge commit
git push origin main

# Worker B fixes issues on worker-b branch
cd /home/jdubz/Development/job-finder-app/job-finder-FE-worker-b
# Fix issues, test, recommit
```

### If Production Deploy Fails

```bash
# Use Firebase Hosting rollback
firebase hosting:clone job-finder-fe:live job-finder-fe:previous

# Or revert last commit and redeploy
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
# CI/CD will automatically redeploy previous version
```

## Worktree Cleanup (After Completion)

Once both workers complete their work and all merges are done:

```bash
# Remove worktrees
cd /home/jdubz/Development/job-finder-app/job-finder-FE
git worktree remove ../job-finder-FE-worker-a
git worktree remove ../job-finder-FE-worker-b

# Delete worker branches (optional)
git branch -d worker-a
git branch -d worker-b

# Verify worktrees removed
git worktree list
# Expected output: Only main worktree remains
```

## Communication & Coordination

### Daily Standups (Recommended)

- **Time:** 15 minutes at start of day
- **Format:** What did you complete? What are you working on today? Any blockers?
- **Goal:** Keep both workers aligned and identify conflicts early

### Weekly Handoff Meetings

- **Week 4 End:** Review Document Builder + Content Items (Worker A) and AI Prompts + Config (Worker B)
- **Week 5 End:** Review Queue Management + Testing (Worker A) and Settings + E2E (Worker B)
- **Week 6 End:** Review CI/CD + Documentation (Worker B) and final integration

### Slack/Discord Channel

- Use dedicated channel for quick questions
- Share code snippets and screenshots
- Tag each other for reviews
