# Authentication Implementation Plan - Job Queue Security

**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Estimated Time**: 8 hours
**Related Audit**: Phase 1 - Critical Security Fixes

## Overview

Add authentication requirement to job queue submissions to prevent spam, abuse, and unauthorized AI processing costs. Implementation must maintain unobtrusive UX for portfolio visitors while providing transparency about data usage.

## Security Problem

Currently, the `job-queue` Firestore collection allows unauthenticated public writes:
- Anyone can submit unlimited job URLs
- Each triggers expensive AI analysis (OpenAI/Gemini API calls)
- Creates cost attack vector and service degradation risk
- No rate limiting on submissions

Additionally, `generator_history` and `job-matches` collections are publicly readable, which is intentional for portfolio showcase purposes but should be documented.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Authentication Requirement**
   - Users must authenticate with Google OAuth before submitting jobs
   - Authentication modal appears when unauthenticated user attempts submission
   - After successful authentication, job should auto-submit (no re-click required)
   - Form data should be preserved through auth flow

2. **User Experience**
   - Non-authenticated users can view and fill out the job submission form
   - Authentication only required at submission time (not page load)
   - Modal explains why authentication is needed (spam prevention, cost management)
   - Clear privacy statement: Google account only used for authentication
   - No account creation step - signing in with Google is sufficient
   - Cancel option preserves form data

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Authenticated users: Maximum 10 job submissions per 15 minutes
   - Rate limits tracked per user (by user ID)
   - Job-finder automated service: Unlimited submissions (exempt from rate limits)
   - Clear error message when rate limit exceeded

4. **Service Account Integration**
   - Python job-finder worker must continue to write to job-queue collection
   - Service account writes should be distinguished with metadata
   - Service account should bypass rate limiting
   - No changes to existing job-finder workflow

5. **Data Privacy**
   - `job-matches` collection remains publicly readable (portfolio showcase)
   - `generator_history` collection remains publicly readable (portfolio showcase)
   - `job-queue` collection readable by anyone (for status checking)
   - User submissions should include user ID for tracking

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Security**
   - Firestore security rules enforce authentication at database level
   - Cloud Function validation provides secondary enforcement
   - Service account access properly controlled
   - No client-side security bypasses possible

2. **Performance**
   - Auth modal loads quickly (<500ms)
   - Rate limiting doesn't add significant latency (<50ms)
   - Auto-submit after auth feels immediate (<1s)

3. **Reliability**
   - Failed auth attempts show clear error messages
   - Network failures handled gracefully
   - Service account writes continue uninterrupted during deployment

4. **Testing**
   - All authentication flows testable in emulator
   - Rate limiting verifiable in local testing
   - Service account integration testable without production deployment

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Firestore Security Rules

**Goal**: Enforce authentication at database level

**Requirements**:
- Update `job-queue` collection rules to require authentication for create operations
- Exception: Allow writes from service accounts with `job-finder-service` role
- Keep read access public (status checking)
- Update `job-matches` collection rules to allow service account writes
- Document that `generator_history` and `job-matches` remain public for showcase

**Validation**:
- Unauthenticated users cannot write to job-queue collection
- Authenticated users can write to job-queue collection
- Service accounts can write to job-queue collection
- Anyone can read from all collections
- Test with Firebase emulator

**Files Affected**:
- `firestore.rules`

### Phase 2: Service Account Configuration

**Goal**: Allow job-finder Python worker to continue writing to Firestore

**Requirements**:
- Service account should have custom claim identifying it as `job-finder-service`
- OR: Accept that service accounts bypass Firestore rules entirely
- Add metadata to service-submitted jobs for auditing purposes
- Metadata should include: `submitted_by: "job-finder-service"`, `submission_source: "automated"`
- Ensure service account credentials properly configured in job-finder

**Validation**:
- Job-finder worker can create job-queue items
- Job-finder worker can create job-match items
- Submitted items have proper metadata
- No disruption to existing automated job processing

**Files Affected**:
- `job-finder/src/job_finder/queue/manager.py` (metadata addition)
- Service account configuration (optional custom claims)

### Phase 3: Rate Limiting Middleware

**Goal**: Prevent abuse even from authenticated users

**Requirements**:
- Implement rate limiting at Cloud Function level
- 10 requests per 15-minute window per authenticated user
- User identification by Firebase Auth UID
- Fallback to IP address if user not authenticated (shouldn't happen after Phase 1)
- Service accounts exempt from rate limiting
- Clear error response when limit exceeded
- Standard rate limit headers in response

**Validation**:
- Authenticated user can submit 10 jobs rapidly
- 11th submission within window returns rate limit error
- After 15 minutes, user can submit again
- Service account submissions not rate limited
- Rate limit error message is user-friendly

**Files Affected**:
- Rate limiting middleware file
- `functions/src/job-queue.ts` (apply middleware)

### Phase 4: Authentication Modal Component

**Goal**: Provide unobtrusive auth flow with transparency

**Requirements**:
- Modal component that overlays the page
- Triggered when unauthenticated user attempts job submission
- Content sections:
  - Title: "Sign in to Submit Jobs"
  - Explanation: Why authentication is required (spam prevention, cost management)
  - Privacy statement: What data is used and what it's used for
  - Privacy bullet points:
    - Only Google account used for authentication
    - No personal data accessed beyond email
    - Only used for spam prevention
    - Information never shared
  - Primary action: "Sign in with Google" button
  - Secondary action: "Cancel" button
- Modal should be dismissable (click outside or X button)
- Loading state during sign-in process
- Error handling for failed sign-in attempts
- Accessible (keyboard navigation, screen reader friendly)

**Validation**:
- Modal appears when unauthenticated user clicks submit
- Modal does not appear for authenticated users
- Sign-in button initiates Google OAuth flow
- Cancel preserves form data
- Success triggers auto-submit
- Error shows clear message
- Keyboard and screen reader accessible

**Files Affected**:
- New authentication modal component file
- Component styling

### Phase 5: Job Submission Flow Updates

**Goal**: Integrate auth check into submission flow

**Requirements**:
- Check authentication state before submission
- If not authenticated:
  - Store pending submission data (URL, company name)
  - Show authentication modal
  - On successful auth, auto-submit using stored data
  - On cancel, preserve form data for later
- If authenticated:
  - Submit directly without modal
- Handle auth state changes during user session
- Clear pending submission after success or permanent cancel
- Maintain existing submission success/error handling

**Validation**:
- Unauthenticated submission triggers modal
- Authenticated submission proceeds directly
- Form data preserved through auth flow
- Auto-submit works after successful auth
- Cancel preserves form for retry
- Multiple cancel/retry cycles work correctly

**Files Affected**:
- `web/src/components/tabs/JobFinderTab.tsx`

### Phase 6: API Error Handling

**Goal**: Provide clear feedback for auth and rate limit errors

**Requirements**:
- Detect HTTP 401/403 responses (authentication errors)
- Detect HTTP 429 responses (rate limit errors)
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Log errors for debugging
- Differentiate between auth errors and other failures
- Don't expose sensitive error details to users

**Error Messages**:
- 401/403: "You must be signed in to perform this action"
- 429: "Too many requests. Please wait a few minutes before trying again."
- Other errors: Use existing error handling

**Validation**:
- Auth errors show appropriate message
- Rate limit errors show appropriate message
- Errors logged for debugging
- Sensitive details not exposed to users

**Files Affected**:
- `web/src/api/ApiClient.ts`
- `web/src/api/job-queue-client.ts`

### Phase 7: Testing

**Goal**: Verify all functionality works as expected

**Test Scenarios**:

**Firestore Rules**:
- Unauthenticated write to job-queue fails

- Public read from generator_history succeeds

**UI/UX Flow**:
- User fills form without auth â†’ modal appears
- Modal displays correct explanation and privacy info
- Cancel button closes modal and preserves form data
- Sign in button initiates Google OAuth
- Successful auth closes modal and auto-submits job
- Form clears after successful submission
- Error during auth shows clear message

**Rate Limiting**:
- User can submit 10 jobs in succession
- 11th job within 15 minutes returns rate limit error
- After 15 minute window, user can submit again
- Service account unlimited submissions
- Rate limit error message is clear

**Job-Finder Integration**:
- Python worker can create job-queue items
- Python worker can create job-match items
- Service submissions include proper metadata
- No disruption to automated processing

**Error Handling**:
- Network failures handled gracefully
- Invalid auth tokens rejected
- Expired tokens refresh properly
- API errors show user-friendly messages

**Accessibility**:

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Breaking job-finder integration
**Mitigation**: Test service account writes thoroughly before production deployment. Have rollback plan ready.

### Risk: Users frustrated by auth requirement
**Mitigation**: Clear explanation in modal, emphasis on transparency and privacy. Portfolio nature of site means this is acceptable trade-off.

### Risk: Rate limiting too restrictive
**Mitigation**: Start with 10 per 15 min, monitor usage patterns, adjust if needed. Document how to change limits.

### Risk: Auth modal UX issues
**Mitigation**: Extensive testing in staging, accessibility review, multiple device testing.

### Risk: Service disruption during deployment
**Mitigation**: Deploy to staging first, phased production rollout, rollback plan ready.

## Notes

- This implementation addresses HIGH-001 from the security audit
- The portfolio showcase nature means some data intentionally remains public
- Service account integration is critical - job-finder must continue working
- UX transparency about auth is a key requirement, not just a nice-to-have
- Google OAuth only - no email/password or other auth methods needed
