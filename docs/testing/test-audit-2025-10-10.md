# Test Coverage Audit - October 10, 2025

## Executive Summary

**Current State:**
- **Functions Tests:** 51.86% coverage (82 tests) - ✅ GOOD
- **Web Tests:** 3.27% coverage (26 tests) - ⚠️ CRITICAL GAP
- **Total Tests:** 108 tests across 9 test files

**Critical Finding:**
Today's API response format bug reached staging because:
1. Web tests only covered component rendering (smoke tests)
2. No integration tests validating API contracts between frontend/backend
3. Pre-push and CI were not enforcing functions tests

## Coverage Breakdown

### Functions (Backend) - 51.86% Coverage ✅

#### What's Covered (82 tests):
- ✅ **Experience API** (`experience.test.ts` - 23 tests)
  - GET /experience/entries (public)
  - POST /experience/entries (auth required)
  - PUT /experience/entries/:id (auth required)
  - DELETE /experience/entries/:id (auth required)
  - Response structure validation
  - Error handling

- ✅ **Experience Service** (`experience.service.test.ts` - 18 tests)
  - CRUD operations
  - Firestore interactions
  - Data validation

- ✅ **Blurb Service** (`blurb.service.test.ts` - 18 tests)
  - CRUD operations
  - Unique title validation

- ✅ **Authentication** (`auth.middleware.test.ts` - 6 tests)
  - Firebase token verification
  - Editor role validation

- ✅ **Database Config** (`database.test.ts` - 17 tests)
  - Environment-specific database selection
  - Emulator detection
  - Priority order of env vars

#### What's NOT Covered:
- ⚠️ **Contact Form API** (index.test.ts only has 1 basic test)
- ⚠️ **Error scenarios** (only 34.15% branch coverage)
- ⚠️ **Integration tests** between services
- ⚠️ **API response format contract** tests

### Web (Frontend) - 3.27% Coverage ❌ CRITICAL

#### What's Covered (26 tests):
- ✅ **Component Smoke Tests** (4 test files)
  - About.test.tsx (7 tests) - renders without crashing
  - Contact.test.tsx (7 tests) - renders without crashing
  - Hero.test.tsx (5 tests) - renders without crashing
  - Projects.test.tsx (7 tests) - renders without crashing

#### What's NOT Covered:
- ❌ **API Client Integration** - No tests for ExperienceClient
- ❌ **API Response Parsing** - No tests validating response structure
- ❌ **React Hooks** - No tests for useExperienceData
- ❌ **Error Handling** - No tests for API error scenarios
- ❌ **Authentication Flow** - No tests for auth context
- ❌ **Form Validation** - No tests for form components
- ❌ **Data Fetching** - No tests for API calls

## Critical Gaps That Led to Today's Bug

### Gap #1: No API Contract Tests
**Problem:** No tests validating the contract between ExperienceClient and backend API.

**What Would Have Caught It:**
```typescript
// web/src/api/__tests__/experience-client.test.ts
describe('ExperienceClient', () => {
  it('should parse API response with data wrapper', async () => {
    const mockResponse = {
      success: true,
      data: { entries: [...], count: 1 },
      requestId: 'test'
    }

    // This would have failed with old backend format
    const result = await experienceClient.getEntries()
    expect(result).toEqual(mockResponse.data.entries)
  })
})
```

### Gap #2: No Integration Tests
**Problem:** Components tested in isolation, never tested with real API calls.

**What Would Have Caught It:**
```typescript
// web/src/__tests__/integration/experience-page.test.tsx
it('should fetch and display experience entries', async () => {
  // Mock API with actual expected format
  // Would fail if response structure changed
})
```

### Gap #3: Weak Pre-Push Enforcement
**Problem:** Pre-push hook allowed test failures to pass through.

**Fixed:** Now blocks push on any test failure.

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Before Resume Generator Merge)

1. **Add API Contract Tests** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   ```
   web/src/api/__tests__/
   ├── client.test.ts          # Base ApiClient tests
   ├── experience-client.test.ts  # Experience API contract
   └── contact-client.test.ts   # Contact form API contract
   ```

2. **Add Integration Tests** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   ```
   web/src/__tests__/integration/
   ├── experience-page.test.tsx  # Full page with API
   └── contact-form.test.tsx     # Form submission flow
   ```

3. **Add Hook Tests** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   ```
   web/src/hooks/__tests__/
   └── useExperienceData.test.ts  # React hooks testing
   ```

4. **Increase Functions Coverage to 70%+** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Add error scenario tests
   - Add edge case tests
   - Add integration tests between services

### Long-term

1. **Set Coverage Thresholds**
   ```json
   // jest.config.js
   coverageThreshold: {
     global: {
       statements: 70,
       branches: 60,
       functions: 70,
       lines: 70
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Add E2E Tests**
   - Playwright/Cypress for critical user flows
   - Test staging environment before production

3. **API Contract Testing**
   - Consider Pact or similar contract testing framework
   - Ensure frontend and backend stay in sync

## Test Quality Checklist

### Before Merging Resume Generator:

- [ ] Add ExperienceClient API contract tests
- [ ] Add integration test for experience page
- [ ] Add tests for API error scenarios
- [ ] Verify all new resume generator endpoints have tests
- [ ] Ensure pre-push hook runs all tests (DONE ✅)
- [ ] Ensure CI runs all tests (DONE ✅)

### For Each New Feature:

- [ ] Unit tests for new functions/components
- [ ] Integration tests for new API endpoints
- [ ] Contract tests for API changes
- [ ] Error scenario tests
- [ ] Update this audit document

## Conclusion

**Current Risk Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH

While functions have decent coverage (51.86%), the web layer is critically under-tested (3.27%). The lack of API contract and integration tests allowed a breaking change to reach staging.

**Before merging resume generator:**
1. Add API contract tests for existing experience endpoints
2. Add integration tests for critical paths
3. Ensure new resume endpoints have comprehensive tests

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours to add critical missing tests
