# Session Context - January 15, 2025

## What Was Done This Session

### Job Alerting System Research & Planning

**Objective**: Design a real-time notification system where job-finder can trigger push notifications for perfect match jobs discovered.

**Completed Tasks**:
1. âœ… Researched Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for web push notifications
2. âœ… Analyzed current PWA configuration and infrastructure
3. âœ… Designed comprehensive alerting architecture
4. âœ… Documented implementation plan in NEXT_STEPS.md
5. âœ… Committed and pushed documentation to staging branch

**Key Findings**:

**Current Infrastructure** (Already Available):
- Firebase SDK v12.3.0 with messaging support configured
- PWA manifest already configured (standalone mode, icons, theme colors)
- Service worker headers configured in firebase.json (lines 84-90)
- Cloud Functions infrastructure ready for webhook endpoint
- Firestore database for token storage

**What's Missing for Push Notifications**:
- Firebase Cloud Messaging initialization
- Service worker file (`firebase-messaging-sw.js`)
- User notification permission UI flow
- FCM device token storage in Firestore
- Webhook Cloud Function endpoint

**Architecture Designed**:

1. **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** - Web push notifications
   - VAPID keys required (generate in Firebase Console)
   - Supports background notifications (browser closed)
   - FREE for web push (no cost)

2. **Webhook Endpoint** - `POST /jobAlerts`
   - Receives alerts from job-finder
   - Validates payload (job details, match score)
   - Sends FCM notification to user
   - API key authentication + rate limiting

3. **Service Worker** - Background notification handler
   - Shows notification with job details
   - Opens job URL on click
   - Must be at root: `/firebase-messaging-sw.js`

4. **User Subscription Flow**
   - Request notification permission
   - Get FCM registration token
   - Store token in Firestore `fcm_tokens` collection
   - Handle token refresh

**Implementation Phases** (8-10 hours total):
- Phase 1: FCM Setup (1-2 hours)
- Phase 2: User Subscription (2-3 hours)
- Phase 3: Webhook Endpoint (2-3 hours)
- Phase 4: Service Worker (1-2 hours)
- Phase 5: Testing (1-2 hours)

**Browser Support**:
- Chrome/Edge/Firefox: Full support
- Safari iOS 16.4+: Push notifications supported (requires "Add to Home Screen" first)
- Safari macOS: Full support

**Data Flow**:
```
job-finder discovers match
  â†“
POST /jobAlerts webhook
  â†“
Validate payload + check user preferences
  â†“
Fetch FCM tokens from Firestore
  â†“
Send push notification via Firebase Admin SDK
  â†“
User receives notification (even if browser closed)
  â†“
User clicks notification
  â†“
Opens job URL in new tab
```

## Files Modified This Session

- `docs/development/NEXT_STEPS.md` - Added Tier 4 alerting architecture (205 lines)

## Files Examined (Research)

- `firebase.json` - Confirmed service worker headers configured
- `web/package.json` - Confirmed Firebase SDK v12.3.0 installed
- `web/src/utils/firebase-app-check.ts` - Reviewed Firebase app initialization
- `web/gatsby-config.ts` - Reviewed PWA manifest configuration
- `firestore-debug.log` - Reviewed emulator status
- `functions/dist/package.json` - Reviewed function build artifacts

## Current State

**Branch**: staging (up to date with remote)
**Recent Commit**: `55fb4dd` - "docs: add real-time job alerting architecture to next steps"
**Tests**: All passing (211 total: 169 functions + 42 web)
**Linting**: Clean (except untracked files from previous work)

**Untracked Files** (not part of this session):
- `functions/src/utils/date-format.ts`
- `scripts/analyze-blurb-markdown.ts`
- `scripts/check-blurb-types.ts`
- `scripts/check-blurbs.ts`
- `scripts/copy-prod-to-local.js`
- `scripts/inspect-experience-data.ts`
- `scripts/list-collections.ts`
- `test-api-response.js`
- `web/src/components/DraggableBlurbList.tsx` (has TypeScript errors)
- `web/src/components/DraggableExperienceList.tsx` (has TypeScript errors)

These files are from previous work and should be reviewed/cleaned up separately.

## Next Session Recommendations

### Option 1: Implement Job Alerting (Recommended)
Start with Phase 1 and Phase 2 to get basic notifications working:

**Phase 1: FCM Setup**
1. Generate VAPID keys in Firebase Console
2. Create `web/src/utils/firebase-messaging.ts`
3. Create `web/static/firebase-messaging-sw.js`
4. Initialize FCM in `web/gatsby-browser.tsx`

**Phase 2: User Subscription**
1. Create `web/src/components/NotificationSettings.tsx`
2. Create `web/src/hooks/useNotifications.ts`
3. Add Firestore collection `fcm_tokens`
4. Test local notification flow

**Resources Needed**:
- Firebase Console access to generate VAPID keys
- Time estimate: 3-5 hours for Phases 1 & 2

### Option 2: Clean Up Untracked Files
Review and either commit or delete the 10 untracked files from previous work.

### Option 3: Continue Other Work
Refer to `docs/development/NEXT_STEPS.md` for other prioritized tasks:
- Bulk Generation Queue (Tier 1, Item 3)
- Job Match Edit UI (Tier 1, Item 4)
- Smart Filtering & Sorting (Tier 2, Item 5)

## Important Context for Next Session

**Firebase Configuration**:
- Project ID: `static-sites-257923`
- Staging Database: `portfolio-staging`
- Production Database: `portfolio`
- Firebase SDK already includes messaging support

**Security**:
- VAPID keys should be stored in Google Cloud Secret Manager
- Webhook will need API key authentication
- User opt-in required (browser notification permission)

**Integration with job-finder**:
- Will need to provide webhook URL and API key to job-finder
- Recommended criteria: alert on match score >85%
- Webhook payload format documented in NEXT_STEPS.md

**Documentation**:
- Complete architecture in `docs/development/NEXT_STEPS.md` (lines 427-627)
- Includes code examples, security considerations, and deployment steps

## Questions to Consider

1. When should we generate VAPID keys? (Needs Firebase Console access)
2. What notification threshold makes sense? (Default: >85% match score)
3. Should we implement topic-based subscriptions from the start? (frontend jobs, backend jobs, etc.)
4. How should we handle users with multiple devices? (Store multiple tokens per user)
5. What's the notification UX? (In-app banner vs permission prompt timing)

## Related Previous Work

This session continues the job-finder integration work:
- âœ… One-click generation from Job Applications (completed)
- âœ… Intelligent context utilization (verified complete)
- âœ… Job Match AI integration (completed)
- ðŸŽ¯ Real-time alerting (architecture designed, ready to implement)

The alerting system completes the pipeline:
**Discovery (job-finder) â†’ Alert (FCM) â†’ Review (UI) â†’ Generate (AI) â†’ Apply**

---

**Next Step**: Implement Phase 1 (FCM Setup) and Phase 2 (User Subscription) to enable basic push notifications.
