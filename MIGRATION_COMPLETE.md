## Final Architecture

### What Remains ✅

**Frontend (Portfolio Only):**
- Homepage with parallax sections
- Contact page with functional form
- Legal pages (Privacy, Terms)
- App placeholder for future React app
- Case studies (if any)
- 404 error page

**Backend (Contact Form Only):**
- Single Cloud Function: `handleContactForm`
- Mailgun email delivery
- Rate limiting & validation
- Firebase App Check security
- Template rendering

**Infrastructure:**
- Firebase Hosting (static site)
- Cloud Functions Gen 2 (contact form)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD (cleaned)
- Minimal dependencies

### What Was Removed ✅

**Job Finder Features:**
- AI Resume Generator (OpenAI, Gemini)
- PDF Generation (Puppeteer)
- Experience Management
- Job Queue System
- Firebase Authentication
- Firestore Database
- Cloud Storage

**Dependencies Removed:**
- 25+ packages (~70% reduction)
- All AI/ML libraries
- PDF generation tools
- Firebase Admin SDK
- Database SDKs

## Deployment Status

### Current Branch: `staging`
- ✅ Worker A changes committed
- ✅ Worker B changes committed
- ✅ All builds passing
- ✅ Ready for deployment

### Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Staging:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:staging
   ```

2. **Test on Staging:**
   - Verify homepage loads
   - Test contact form submission
   - Check all navigation
   - Verify email delivery

3. **Create PR to Main:**
   - Review all changes
   - Get approval
   - Merge to main

4. **Deploy to Production:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:production
   ```

5. **Monitor:**
   - Check logs for errors
   - Verify analytics working
   - Monitor performance metrics

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

```bash
# View recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# Revert specific commit
git revert <commit-hash>

# Or restore from main branch
git checkout main -- web/package.json
git checkout main -- functions/package.json
npm install
```

---

## Key Decisions

### Firebase SDK Kept
**Decision:** Keep Firebase client SDK for App Check
**Reason:** Contact form security requires Firebase App Check
**Impact:** Minimal overhead, essential for security

### Emulator Config Kept
**Decision:** Keep Firebase emulator configuration
**Reason:** Defensive configuration, may be useful for future features
**Impact:** No performance impact (opt-in development tool)

### /app Placeholder Created
**Decision:** Create "Coming Soon" page at /app route
**Reason:** Prepare for future React application integration
**Impact:** User-friendly message, sets expectations
