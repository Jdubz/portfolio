## About

> Calm, precise, curious; playful details used sparingly.

I'm a multidisciplinary engineer who thrives at the intersection of software development, electronics design, and digital fabrication. My approach combines technical precision with creative problem-solving to build end-to-end solutions.

Whether it's developing embedded systems, crafting interactive installations, or engineering custom lighting solutions, I believe in the power of bringing together different domains to create something greater than the sum of its parts.

My work spans from writing clean, efficient code to designing PCBs and fabricating custom enclosures. I'm passionate about projects that challenge conventional boundaries and require inventive thinking.
