Consolidate and streamline documentation (64% reduction)

Removed outdated documentation directories (audit, archive, deployment, setup, features) that were superseded by ARCHITECTURE.md and CODEBASE_AUDIT_2025-10-10.md. Updated ai-resume-generator-plan.md with Phase 1-3 architecture compatibility notes. Documentation reduced from 44 files (~16,000 lines) to 10 files (~5,700 lines), focusing on current architecture, recent audits, and future plans.
