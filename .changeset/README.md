# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Creating a Changeset

When you make changes to the codebase, create a changeset to document them:

```bash
npm run changeset
```

This will:

1. Prompt you to select which packages changed
2. Ask for the version bump type (patch, minor, major)
3. Request a summary of your changes
4. Create a new markdown file in this directory

**Commit the changeset file with your PR!**

## When to Create a Changeset

✅ **Create a changeset for:**

- New features
- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- Breaking changes
- User-facing changes

❌ **Skip changeset for:**

- Documentation updates
- Test changes
- CI/CD config
- Internal refactoring

## Need Help?

See our [Changeset Workflow Guide](../docs/development/changesets-workflow.md) for detailed instructions.

## Enforcement

This project uses **gentle reminders** rather than strict blocking:

- Local commits will show a reminder if you forget
- GitHub PRs will get a friendly comment
- You can still commit/merge without a changeset if needed

See [Changeset Enforcement](../docs/development/changeset-enforcement.md) for details.
