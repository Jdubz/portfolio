Add professional attribution footer to generated documents

Added subtle footer to resume and cover letter PDFs that showcases the custom AI resume builder as a portfolio piece:
- Footer text: "Generated by a custom AI resume builder built by the candidate"
- Includes clickable link to joshwentworth.com/resume-builder
- Styled professionally (8pt, light gray, bottom center)
- Appeals to technical recruiters by demonstrating AI/full-stack capabilities
- Turns the resume itself into a portfolio demonstration

This enhancement helps the generated documents serve double duty as both application materials and portfolio pieces.
